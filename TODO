High priority:
- Fix crash on launch
	"Quality" in plist gets set to "2147483647" seemingly at random. Causes crash.

Medium priority:
- Block the misnamed CSI: New York S7E3
	Create a whole blocklist preference where users can block shows, episodes, etc?
	Maybe a blacklist.txt listing torrent URLs, to make this easier to update if this happens again?
- Create a more user-friendly uninstaller
- Ignore "The" at the beginning of the show's title when sorting the list

Low priority:
- Growl notifications
- Merge misnamed/duplicate shows somehow
	Similar to the blacklist.txt feature for misnamed and/or fake episodes?

Feature requests:
- iCal or Mail.app alert for those that have automatic download disabled
	Wrap in to the script for Growl notifications
- When updating the show list, highlight the new additions.
- Support for private trackers
	And possibly any other sources of shows; highly unlikely.
- Grab IMDB/Wikipedia/TV.com info about the show
- Per Show
	- Quality preferences
	- Availability graph (seed-peer ratio)
