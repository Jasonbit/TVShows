High priority:
- Figure out why saving the NIB (even with no changes) breaks grabbing the Qualities preference.
- Create a more user-friendly uninstaller
- Block the misnamed CSI: New York S7E3
	Create a whole blocklist preference where users can block shows, episodes, etc?
	Maybe a blacklist.txt listing torrent URLs, to make this easier to update if this happens again?

Medium priority:
- Ignore "The" at the beginning of the show's title when sorting the list
- Growl notifications
- Merge misnamed/duplicate shows somehow
	Similar to the blacklist.txt feature for misnamed and/or fake episodes?

Low priority:
- When updating the show list, highlight the new additions.

Feature requests:
- iCal or Mail.app alert for those that have automatic download disabled
	Wrap in to the script for Growl notifications
- Support for private trackers
	And possibly any other sources of shows; highly unlikely.
- Grab IMDB/Wikipedia/TV.com info about the show
- Per Show
	- Quality preferences
	- Availability graph (seed-peer ratio)
